# Here used to be Firefly

Firefly was an opinionated Waterfall fork aiming to band aid various upstream issues, pull in bunch of performance patches from
a better software called [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com).

It wasn't very popular, but was at least used by three networks and code stealing source/revenue generator
for various [MC-Market](https://www.mc-market.org) "BungeeCord forks" which didn't give any cent back to the developer(s), nor even a proper credit.

Since **2020.12.30**, this software has been archived because of no interest to maintain it (@mikroskeem has migrated to Velocity), nor
anyone was interested enough to pick it up completely.

I do not want any requests/questions about this project in any form.

Expect no support whatsoever. I consider anyone contacting me to help with this dumb codebase to be an idiot.
